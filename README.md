<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

A transcription of types from the [`OpenRPC` Specification](https://spec.open-rpc.org/).

This library does NOT perform more complicated validation of the spec, including:
- unique method names
- unique error codes
- reference idents

> When quoted, the specification will appear as blockquoted text, like so.
